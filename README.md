# SDA Data Visualisation

Tooling to make the NDIA's quarterly **Supplement P: Specialist Disability
Accommodation** readable — and in particular to answer the question the
published workbook cannot: *is a given SDA design category undersupplied in a
given region?*

The proposal this supports is written up as a separate document; this repository
holds the extraction and derivation step it depends on.

## Why the workbook needs a script

Supplement P is internally consistent and complete, but four structural features
make it hard to use directly:

1. **Supply and demand live in different tables.** Dwellings by design category
   are in Table P.5; participants needing each design category are in Table P.10.
2. **They are counted in different units.** Supply is dwellings, demand is
   participants. A five-resident group home is one dwelling but five places.
3. **The cross-tabs are flattened.** Tables P.11, P.12 and P.16 squash two
   dimensions into a single header row of up to 74 columns, e.g.
   `House, 3 residents - Robust`.
4. **The only trend data is not in any cell.** Figure P.1's thirteen quarters of
   national history exist solely inside embedded chart XML and the figure's
   accessibility description.

Two file-format quirks also need handling: the NDIA publishes in **Strict
OOXML**, which `openpyxl` refuses until the namespace URIs are rewritten, and
Excel parks filtered-out chart series in the `c15` extension namespace, where a
naive parse silently merges several series into one.

## The derivation

Because each column header in P.11/P.12/P.16 names its own resident capacity,
multiplying the dwelling count by that capacity and summing by design category
yields **places** — resident capacity — which is directly comparable with a
participant count.

This is verifiable rather than assumed. The NDIA publishes places for new builds
only, in Table P.7. Running the derivation over P.11 reproduces P.7 exactly, for
every design category in all 88 SA4 regions. It then extends to existing and
legacy stock (P.12) and to the pipeline (P.16), where no published places figure
exists.

Sanity checks that hold for the 2025-26 Q4 file: summing the 88 SA4 regions gives
14,235 enrolled dwellings and 25,658 participants with an SDA need, both matching
Figure P.1's national totals exactly.

## Usage

```sh
pip install openpyxl
python3 scripts/extract_sda.py <Supplement_P_*.xlsx> -o data/
```

Writes `data/sda.json` (~900 KB) containing:

| Key | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `national_trend` | 13 quarters × 6 series recovered from Figure P.1 |
| `national_summary` | places, need, pipeline and ratio per design category |
| `sa4` / `sa3` | one record per region, with a per-category breakdown |

Each region's `categories` block carries `enrolled_dwellings`,
`enrolled_places`, `pipeline_places`, `participants_with_need` and
`places_per_participant`.

## Reading the numbers honestly

- **`places_per_participant` is not unmet demand.** Enrolled places include
  places already occupied, and participants with an SDA need include people
  already living in SDA. The measure shows mismatch of *mix* — a participant
  assessed as needing Fully Accessible but housed in a Basic dwelling appears on
  both sides, in different categories. Never label it "shortfall".
- **A fifth of demand has no design category.** 4,991 of 25,658 participants
  (19.5%) sit in P.10's "Missing" column. Large enough to move any ratio.
- **Suppressed cells are not zeros.** Small counts publish as `<11`, `<5`, `n/a`
  (54 cells in this file). `parse_value` returns `None` plus the disclosed
  ceiling so they are never summed as zero.
- **The pipeline is an intention, not a forecast.** The NDIA states pipeline
  dwellings may never be enrolled, may be enrolled in a different category, and
  may already be enrolled but not yet removed from the data.
- **Table P.1 is not joinable.** It keys on NDIA Service Districts, not SA4;
  P.2 and P.3 key on State only.
- **Basic and Multi-Design Category have no demand counterpart.** Neither is
  issued as an eligibility decision, so only the four categories in
  `COMPARABLE_CATEGORIES` support a supply-versus-demand comparison.
- **SA boundaries changed** from 2011 to 2016 definitions in March 2023, which
  limits comparability with earlier supplements.
